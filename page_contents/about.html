  What do I do? I do web and app development through my business, <a href="http://velociraptorsystems.com" class="newwindow">Velociraptor Systems</a>, doing maintenance, NDA work for startups, and work for universities and their affiliates.
</p>
<p>
  You'll also find me working with lizards and amphibians, doing husbandry as well as rehabilitation.
</p>
<p>
  You might also find me helping to teach undergrads to make museum specimens at UC Berkeley.
</p>
<p>
  When I have down time, you might find me putting up some code for fun.
</p>
<p>
  Take a look around and get a feel.
</p>
<p>
  If you found something I've done useful, how about buying me a cup
  of coffee?
